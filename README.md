# AmazonX-Ray

Final Project for CSCI-E-81. 

This project was collaborated with Nirmal Labh. 

In this project, I attempted to recreate Amazon X-Ray i.e. using machine learning and data mining to extract relavant information for a video clip based on the current scene. For example:Actors on screen, Sceen segmentation, relevant Trivia information. 

In the future I would like to extend this to Audio recognition as well for the soundtrack.
