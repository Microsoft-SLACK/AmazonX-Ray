1
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,463
Ï'LL be back to help.

2
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:16,254
Honey, did you bring the wine?

3
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,621
We still have lots to do.
-Like what?

4
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:25,935
Just give me a hand.

5
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:33,939
l wanted to get my hair done.

6
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:42,338
l'm definitely taking a shower.

7
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:47,458
Are you okay?
-Yes.

8
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,978
Which ones?

9
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:19,498
Those.

10
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:25,054
Okay, so don't ask me then.

11
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:30,861
Did you bring my suit?
-The blue one.

12
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,659
You wanted the dark suit.
l figured you meant the blue one.

13
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:40,261
Yes, that's fine.
-lt's the one you wanted, right?

14
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:53,860
Just relax, will you?

15
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,261
Watch the shaving cream.

16
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:04,054
Mom asked me to call her today.

17
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,978
What?

18
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:17,414
Go ahead and call her.
But do it before Alexandra and...

19
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:21,464
Timo.
-Right, Alexandra and Timo get here.

20
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,861
They're not going to show.

21
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:35,778
Of course they will.

22
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,821
They took another look at our picture
and forgot to cancel.

23
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,943
Don't be silly. They're just late.

24
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:07,858
Julian here. Hey, hello.

25
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:15,936
Yes? No, take a right at
the riding school. Yes, a right.

26
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,858
Okay, see you in bit. Bye.

27
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:31,103
l hope they look okay.
The pictures could be 10 years old.

28
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:58,454
Nice house.
-Did you have trouble finding it?

29
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:03,221
Were the directions easy to follow?
-Yes, they were fine.

30
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,264
But you got lost.
-Alex says it was my mistake.

31
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:12,545
l said to the right, so he went left.
-l tend to get confused.

32
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:15,856
l'll go get the luggage.

33
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:18,778
Shall l help you?

34
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,341
Gorgeous house.

35
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:28,454
lt's my parents'.
They're on vacation, so it's no problem.

36
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,456
l'd like parents like that.

37
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,538
Would you like meat or fish for dinner?

38
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:41,414
Fish would be nice.
-Meat would be nice.

39
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:45,260
Well, then let's have the fish today...
-Meat.

40
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,264
And the meat tomorrow.
-Fine.

41
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,738
l'll get started.

42
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,502
What was it you did again, Julian?

43
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:07,578
l'm in finance.
l'm an investment consultant.

44
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:11,818
Sounds like a responsible job.
-Yes, it is. l, eh...

45
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:16,103
lsn't it frustrating to be dealing
with other people's money?

46
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,499
No, not really.

47
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,257
Timo's an internist.

48
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,503
At the Radboud hospital.

49
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,020
You must work long hours.

50
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,659
Julian.
-Yes, l'm coming.

51
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:46,057
What?

52
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:49,463
Will you do the snacks and the drinks?

53
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:01,658
How is it in there?

54
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,098
Great. Cozy.

55
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:11,023
l'd recognize Diana from the photo,
not you.

56
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:14,860
How do you mean?

57
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:17,220
Just different.

58
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:21,139
You two look just like you do
in the picture.

59
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,455
So this is really your first time?

60
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:30,183
We're very excited about it.
-Welcome to the club.

61
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,417
l can hardly remember our first time.

62
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:35,541
That was so long ago.

63
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:39,981
Oh dear, l forgot the snacks. Sorry.

64
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:02,503
That's a nice skirt you're wearing.
-lt's nothing fancy.

65
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:06,499
lt looks good on you.
-Thanks.

66
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:08,462
You have a nice figure.

67
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:27,863
l'm not making you nervous?

68
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,257
Where's the restroom?

69
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:39,938
ln the hall.

70
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:21,977
lt's cozy in here.
-lsn't it?

71
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:25,854
The best parties are in the kitchen.
-You're in my way.

72
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:29,859
Put that away. We'll do it later.

73
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:34,064
Shall l read your palm?
-Don't tell me you believe in that.

74
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,900
Hands say a lot about people.

75
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,057
Well, l don't buy it.
-Come on.

76
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:46,423
Who you are depends on
how you were raised and your genes.

77
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:51,500
Lines, stars, tea leaves, whatever,
have nothing to do with it.

78
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:56,261
Look, only two things count in life:
Power and love.

79
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:03,020
What do you say?
-You're a caring person.

80
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:08,458
Still waters...
And repressed desires.

81
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:13,615
You must be a Cancer.

82
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:17,659
You try to measure up to others.

83
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:20,857
You're struggling.

84
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:28,619
Alex, let's have some dinner.
-But with what?

85
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:39,863
Enjoy your meal.

86
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:46,133
Music. Any preferences?

87
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:49,619
l was only guessing, okay?

88
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,138
Enjoy, people.

89
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:56,696
l want you to know
l'm having a great time.

90
00:12:56,865 --> 00:13:01,256
Good, l'm glad that's taken care of.
The fish looks delicious.

91
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:08,897
So Julian, you turned the scales.

92
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:11,533
Yes, more or less.

93
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:15,698
We fantasized about it.
-That's how it usually goes.

94
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:21,223
What usually goes like that?
-Usually it's the man who proposes it.

95
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,457
Women are more coy
about their sexual fantasies.

96
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,741
That's true.
-Nonsense.

97
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:30,495
Yes, l was at a bookstore...

98
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:35,693
and l'm looking at those silly
glossy women's magazines.

99
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:39,824
And in bold letters,
all the covers said was: Sex, sex, sex.

100
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,863
So l think women are catching up fast.

101
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,698
l know many women
who aren't like that.

102
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:51,701
Plenty of them need lots of erogenous
stimulation before they do anything.

103
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:56,700
You are an erogenous zone.
-Yes, l listen to my body and give in.

104
00:13:56,865 --> 00:14:01,063
And if he or she reacts in a way
that makes me wet...

105
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:05,776
l go for it. And that applies
to Timo as well, obviously.

106
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,901
We discuss it openly.

107
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:13,662
lt's all about trust,
communication and reflection.

108
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,544
You want to know the best part?

109
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:19,265
l've never been more faithful.

110
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:23,462
We sleep around
without committing adultery.

111
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:38,057
One time we were making love, and l
pretended another woman was present.

112
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:42,661
There was
an obvious physical response.

113
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:50,059
Finally l introduced him to a girlfriend
l had slept with in the past.

114
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,458
On his birthday.

115
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:58,062
That was some present.

116
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:02,065
l'll never give up this freedom.

117
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,660
Does that turn you on?

118
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:14,256
Being spoiled by two women
at the same time?

119
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:21,055
Consider it done.

120
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:28,060
No, l don't have anything against kids.
l work with kids.

121
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:32,218
But l've seen so many people fail.
l don't want that.

122
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:34,853
Why do you think you'd fail?

123
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:39,854
Perhaps being a good parent
is in your genes.

124
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:50,696
We tell my parents we're having trouble
getting pregnant to stop their nagging.

125
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:54,255
This is not about your parents.
You decide.

126
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:59,263
l bet Julian and Alex are having
more fun.

127
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:03,138
l'm not telling you to have children...

128
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:07,139
You don't have children,
you're blessed with them.

129
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:10,138
Sorry, that's what l meant.

130
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:17,783
Listen, l don't know you very well,
but l can already tell you're patient...

131
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:23,099
you're kind and caring.
Surely those are good qualities?

132
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:29,464
That's nice of you to say,
but you're right. You don't know me.

133
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,141
Besides l'd have less time for Julian.

134
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:38,378
Our relationship is solid,
l don't want to put it at risk.

135
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:42,458
And doing this is not a risk?

136
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:49,743
Well...
-Or not?

137
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:52,021
Sometimes.

138
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,538
Give me a hand, dear?

139
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:56,778
A hand.

140
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,178
Now?

141
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:12,938
How's it going?
-l'm up for it.

142
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:18,824
The time is not ripe yet,
at least not for Diana.

143
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:21,135
You think?

144
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:24,900
Something's bothering her.
l don't think she's ready.

145
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,062
l'll talk to her.

146
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,023
Pour me a drink?

147
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,460
You know they don't allow smoking.

148
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,459
They're sitting by the fire.
lt sucks out the smoke.

149
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,858
Wine for my wife.

150
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:54,902
We didn't bring enough.
-Honey.

151
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,540
What?
-Do me a favor.

152
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,015
Try to enjoy yourself.

153
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,378
You're right.

154
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,856
She's very pretty, isn't she?
-Yes.

155
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:16,938
And so are you.

156
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:20,858
How shall we handle this?

157
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:25,699
l don't know. l really don't.

158
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,660
We'll see. Okay?

159
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,464
Of course. No obligations.

160
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:42,658
Diana here.

161
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:49,258
Fine. Everything's under control.

162
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,863
l know. l'm sorry l didn't...

163
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,062
l didn't forget,
we had a lot to do today.

164
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:01,859
No, there's no one here.

165
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:08,656
Gotta go. Julian's waiting.

166
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,457
lt's nice here, huh?

167
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,219
So l'm no one?

168
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:33,264
lt was my mother.
She still thinks l'm sixteen.

169
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:39,101
l lived at home too long.
-Never on your own?

170
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:45,064
My parents are a bit conservative.
-An only child?

171
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:52,259
No, l have a sister,
but l haven't seen her in years.

172
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:58,816
She ran away from home.
-To be on her own?

173
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:03,024
To move to Canada.
-Whoa. Will you look at that.

174
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,857
That's decisive.

175
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,495
Don't feel obligated.

176
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:27,776
Only do it if you're ready for it.

177
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,459
Playing cards can be fun, too.

178
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,458
You know the rules?

179
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:41,461
Couldn't we play another game?
Like strip poker maybe?

180
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,263
Or strip anything.

181
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,901
l don't know this game.
-lt's real simple.

182
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,462
Anybody want a drink?
-Coke.

183
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,978
Wine.

184
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,056
l'll give you a hand.

185
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,015
What are we doing wrong?
-Who knows?

186
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,655
They're not attracted to us.
At least not to me.

187
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,180
What makes you say that?

188
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:20,054
Timo wants to play cards,
and he's not bisexual, okay?

189
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:26,058
They think we don't want to.
Maybe you should loosen up.

190
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,020
That's not very nice.

191
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:34,258
l feel fine, except for the phone call.
So what?

192
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:38,260
There's nothing wrong with them.

193
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:43,459
You were shaky too the first time.

194
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,698
l just want to avoid an emotional scene
once we're upstairs.

195
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:51,175
Let's wait and see.
-Damned beginners.

196
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,463
What?
-Nothing.

197
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:59,145
We're out of wine. We miscalculated.

198
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,698
Something stronger maybe?
-But l'm in the mood for wine.

199
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:10,019
We have juice and soft drinks.
-lsn't there a shop around here?

200
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:14,655
l could drive out to that shop.
-You've been drinking.

201
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:17,218
Timo hasn't.

202
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,461
We can get acquainted.

203
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,698
l'll drive you.

204
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:32,813
Well, l guess we're going.
Be back in half an hour.

205
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,022
What shall l get?
-Wine.

206
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:45,653
Why don't you show Alex the pool?

207
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:48,458
The pool?

208
00:22:51,265 --> 00:22:52,618
Jesus.

209
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:56,658
Fucking hell.

210
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:02,143
There's also a sauna.

211
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:04,694
This house is amazing.

212
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:09,620
l wouldn't mind unwinding a little bit.
You should, too.

213
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:13,255
Where do you turn it on?

214
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:16,938
Let me see...

215
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,380
lt also has ambient sounds.

216
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:25,857
Woods, rainforest and ocean.

217
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,458
Ocean.

218
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:39,098
Sorry.

219
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:43,382
Don't apologize. Get undressed.

220
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:47,218
lt has to warm up.

221
00:23:56,305 --> 00:24:00,457
By the way, on a first time...

222
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,698
does it have to be terrific,
or can nothing happen, too?

223
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:07,459
Why do you ask? Having doubts?

224
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:11,300
No, but l can imagine
the tension getting so high...

225
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:15,060
that you can't get it...
You know what l mean.

226
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:19,184
l sure do, but don't worry.
lt's the game that counts.

227
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:24,740
A sauna completely relaxes me.

228
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:30,263
And a nice dip in the plunge bath.
-l always skip that part.

229
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:36,055
What do your parents do?
Or is it old money?

230
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,854
Does swapping never bother you?

231
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,335
No. Never.

232
00:24:57,945 --> 00:25:02,416
My father works
for a large multinational.

233
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,655
He's on several boards.

234
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,455
This is his hobby.

235
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:15,456
Architecture, landscaping,
interior design.

236
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,378
Architecture.

237
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:25,656
So you never get jealous?
-No.

238
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:34,862
We'll have to see how it goes,
how we do.

239
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:39,098
You're doing just fine.

240
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:43,736
l felt like you guys weren't interested.
-That's not true.

241
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:47,101
We don't want to push.

242
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:55,094
What?
-Do you ever wear your hair down?

243
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:01,182
No, never.
-Why not?

244
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,462
l don't know. l doesn't look good.

245
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,061
Timo likes you a lot.

246
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,858
Really?

247
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:17,856
Actually l do, too.

248
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,263
lt's too hot for me.

249
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,816
Your turn.

250
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:40,055
Let me check. No way.

251
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:48,698
You bitch.

252
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,456
No diving allow...

253
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,935
Can l use your cell phone?
-l left it at your place.

254
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:14,656
My battery is dead.
-The girls can entertain themselves.

255
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:22,653
l'm having a good time.
We'll see what happens.

256
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:24,861
Hold the flashlight.

257
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:34,460
A date like this
could also be a disaster.

258
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:44,784
How long are you two doing it?
-About four years now.

259
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:48,096
lt must be exciting.
-Exciting?

260
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,733
Keeps a relationship interesting.

261
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:54,614
Don't do it to keep it interesting,
and definitely not to save it.

262
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:01,294
Do you really want this?
-Excuse me?

263
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:06,061
We only just met,
but Diana seems a little unsure about it.

264
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:13,059
Diana really wants this. Only she's
a bit nervous about it. So am l.

265
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,817
And you? Do you feel good about this?

266
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:20,055
Be sure about it.

267
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:24,343
lt's a shame if one of you
is doing it just to please the other.

268
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:28,464
We both really want to do it.
-Light.

269
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:37,936
Can l ask you something?
When you two sleep together...

270
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:41,097
is it still exciting?
-Sure.

271
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:50,104
l've known Diana for 10 years, and only
now do l know her fantasies.

272
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:53,541
That's why
communication is so important.

273
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:57,857
And reflection. We always say:
Keep reflecting.

274
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,258
Reflecting.

275
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:08,538
You're excited
by the idea of fucking Alex later.

276
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:15,460
But ask yourself how you'd feel
about me with your wife?

277
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:19,698
That's reflecting.

278
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:25,741
Do many people go to that club?

279
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:32,424
About 1000 people every weekend.
-No, you must be kidding. That many?

280
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:36,863
Oh, yes.
-What kind of people go there?

281
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:42,861
People like you and me. We're not all
blond bimbos like on Jerry Springer.

282
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:47,735
Most of them are 25 to 35 years old.
Beautiful people, too.

283
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:52,581
And you walk around in lingerie?
-That's the dress code.

284
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:54,940
But that's like a nude beach:

285
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:59,064
At first you stare,
and then you hardly notice it.

286
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:03,776
You can have great sex there,
if you're into it.

287
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:05,458
We'll take you guys.

288
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:13,696
Diana is a little insecure. She worries
about her looks, and well, everything.

289
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:18,063
But not about this.
This is something different.

290
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,864
She's a very attractive woman.

291
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:26,060
Different from Alex.
-Quite different.

292
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:33,860
Alex is gorgeous.
Take a right up there.

293
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:39,862
Maybe that makes Diana insecure.
-What does?

294
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:46,058
Women.

295
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:06,263
Thanks, l needed that.

296
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,463
Let me enjoy this first.

297
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:18,654
l must be doing something wrong.
Great house, man.

298
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:24,144
But l doubt Diana's parents are happy,
and you are.

299
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,865
You have a point.

300
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:31,337
lt proves the old cliché:
Money can't buy you happiness.

301
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:34,497
But a beautiful woman
and some fine wine, however...

302
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:37,463
l'm not so sure. Four euros?

303
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:41,061
l bet we'll have hangovers
in the morning.

304
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:52,698
Are you quite sure?

305
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,258
Coming?

306
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:33,864
Why don't you come out?
-No. Don't be so mean.

307
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:24,464
l wish l could make time stand still.

308
00:35:25,945 --> 00:35:27,856
To savor this moment.

309
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:34,256
l wouldn't do that if l were you.
You'll miss what's ahead.

310
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:43,253
Have you sorted it out yet?
-Sorted what out?

311
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:50,542
About tonight.
Whether you want to do it.

312
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:54,061
Timo and l. Have you talked about it?

313
00:35:57,665 --> 00:36:01,101
Not really, but it's okay.
Right?

314
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:08,578
Yes, l'm for it.

315
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:12,941
Timo? Are you awake?

316
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:16,143
Wide awake.

317
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:20,457
Wine?
-l'm in the mood for something else.

318
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:59,655
l have to go to the toilet.

319
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:50,863
That looks hot.

320
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:09,457
What's the matter?

321
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:12,618
Did you fall?

322
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:22,862
What's wrong, dear?

323
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:34,458
He slipped.

324
00:45:35,665 --> 00:45:38,384
Are you okay?
-l'm sorry.

325
00:45:38,545 --> 00:45:42,857
Do you have any band aids?
-Yes, l'll ask Diana.

326
00:45:57,345 --> 00:45:59,620
We leave in the morning.

327
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:38,459
l couldn't sleep.
-Me neither.

328
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:47,459
lt's still a beautiful evening.
-Still want to freeze the moment?

329
00:46:52,865 --> 00:46:54,457
Want to talk about it?

330
00:46:57,865 --> 00:47:03,258
Are you going to analyze me? lt's okay,
he was feeling ill this morning.

331
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,778
Give me a drag?

332
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:24,138
What?

333
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:26,455
l just thought of my parents.

334
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:31,460
They would die.

335
00:47:35,905 --> 00:47:41,855
l'm so tired of being the good girl.
-You're not a good girl anymore.

336
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:48,016
As a kid they didn't let me do anything.
-What do you mean?

337
00:47:48,185 --> 00:47:50,096
No parties?

338
00:47:50,265 --> 00:47:51,618
Makeup?

339
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:54,856
Wine at dinner?

340
00:47:56,625 --> 00:48:01,221
No nail polish, no allowance,
no dance lessons.

341
00:48:01,385 --> 00:48:04,934
No boyfriends, no movies.

342
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:07,573
No blue jeans.
-Jesus.

343
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:14,457
You have a lot to catch up with:
Grass, parties, booze, sex...

344
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:19,784
Who's doing the analyzing now.
-What?

345
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:21,298
Never mind.

346
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:28,662
You think you know me?

347
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:33,853
A palm reading, some amateur
psychology, and that's it?

348
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:41,143
Timo didn't fall.

349
00:48:54,585 --> 00:48:56,655
l had a good time tonight.

350
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:00,378
Thank you.

351
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,861
l hope you guys solve it.

352
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:32,858
Cow.

353
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:49,018
You okay?

354
00:50:15,425 --> 00:50:16,858
Let's sleep.

355
00:50:19,385 --> 00:50:20,864
Full day tomorrow.

356
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:26,863
Good night.
-Good night.

357
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:40,062
Do we have any eggs?

358
00:53:39,665 --> 00:53:42,384
You're up early.
-So are you.

359
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:44,456
Tea?
-No. Coffee.

360
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:48,454
l was going to bring it to you.

361
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:56,862
Shall l take Timo a cup of tea?
-No, he takes coffee with lots of sugar.

362
00:54:04,905 --> 00:54:07,658
He's in the room by the stairs.

363
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:13,663
We leave after breakfast.

364
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:09,136
Good morning.
-Hey, good morning.

365
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:11,418
Coming in?

366
00:55:22,225 --> 00:55:24,864
Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

367
00:55:26,265 --> 00:55:31,055
l see you slept in the spare room.
-l do that when l don't feel well.

368
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:38,258
That was your old room, l bet.
-Yes, my parents keep it that way.

369
00:55:39,705 --> 00:55:41,855
Are you feeling better?

370
00:55:42,025 --> 00:55:47,099
Yes, l don't know what came over me.
l didn't want to bother anyone.

371
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:49,864
Have a good time?

372
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:58,855
Coffee?
-Thanks.

373
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:03,257
How's your hand?
-A little sore. lt'll be alright.

374
00:56:12,665 --> 00:56:16,578
That was nice.
l didn't make you wait long, did l?

375
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:19,020
l'll go and change.

376
00:56:19,185 --> 00:56:23,463
Hey, are you guys coming, or what?
l'm starving.

377
00:56:32,825 --> 00:56:35,862
What shall we do today?
-Go to the woods?

378
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,734
Or we can go to the new exhibition
at the museum.

379
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:44,501
Or a walk on the beach?
-That's a2-hour drive. l'll get coffee.

380
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:53,064
How's your hand? Shouldn't you
have it looked at?

381
00:56:58,545 --> 00:56:59,898
Come here, please?

382
00:57:08,945 --> 00:57:12,335
Well, that's it then.
-What do you mean?

383
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:16,100
Don't be so naive.

384
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:19,462
Can't you see
what's going on with them?

385
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:25,138
Unbelievable.
-So tell me.

386
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,501
What? You want to stay?

387
00:57:33,665 --> 00:57:37,658
We need to talk, but not here.
-And why not?

388
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,463
lf there's no more sex, you're gone.

389
00:57:47,985 --> 00:57:50,943
And you want to build
an intimate friendship?

390
00:57:51,105 --> 00:57:54,063
lsn't that what we put in our ad?

391
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,739
'Friendship and sex...'
-Bull.

392
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:01,057
lf l say A, you say B. And vice versa.
-What's with you?

393
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:05,776
You don't take me seriously.
-You never speak up.

394
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:08,061
They can...
-So what.

395
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:26,015
See what l mean?

396
00:58:26,185 --> 00:58:28,745
l told you so.

397
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,658
Shit.
-Should we say something?

398
00:58:34,705 --> 00:58:37,617
Call me when it's over.
l'll be in the shower.

399
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:40,060
Diana's coming. Behave.

400
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:53,063
l'm sorry about that.
Timo and l are...

401
00:58:54,225 --> 00:58:57,058
Sometimes l don't understand him...

402
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:04,902
and he becomes very obstinate,
which gets my back up and...

403
00:59:05,065 --> 00:59:06,418
l'm sorry.

404
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:09,658
Women.

405
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:15,464
Alex and l had a rough night.

406
00:59:18,105 --> 00:59:21,461
What happened last night?
-Nothing.

407
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:25,299
You call that nothing?

408
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:31,380
This isn't the right moment.
lt's between Alex and l.

409
00:59:31,545 --> 00:59:37,700
The argument wasn't about you guys.
l wouldn't want you to think that.

410
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,858
l mean, l think you guys are great.

411
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:45,063
l think you're great.

412
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,138
Really. And, eh...

413
00:59:52,185 --> 00:59:54,653
Tensions ran high yesterday...

414
00:59:58,865 --> 01:00:02,062
and then he can't get an...
You know.

415
01:00:04,985 --> 01:00:06,862
He gets that sometimes.

416
01:00:10,465 --> 01:00:12,262
But that's no problem.

417
01:00:18,225 --> 01:00:19,943
l'll be in the shower.

418
01:00:54,465 --> 01:00:55,818
Okay.

419
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:02,658
What's up today?

420
01:01:06,185 --> 01:01:09,097
Yes. Surprise me.

421
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,059
The woods? The beach?

422
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:19,057
Or stay here and swim.
-l don't think Diana's up for that.

423
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:24,214
Perhaps a little damage control
is in order.

424
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:28,014
Never mind, Julian, l'll go.
lt's my fault.

425
01:01:30,505 --> 01:01:32,063
He's good at it.

426
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:03,662
Let me be, honey.

427
01:02:05,465 --> 01:02:06,864
Can l come in?

428
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,458
Sorry, l thought it was Julian.

429
01:02:18,945 --> 01:02:24,622
lt's a typical girl's room. l could tell.
-Everything by the book.

430
01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:33,216
Maybe we shouldn't have come.

431
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:39,063
Yes, well, that's the risk you take...

432
01:02:40,705 --> 01:02:46,063
when you've never even met
each other. You know, a blind date.

433
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,455
Oh no, that's not it at all.

434
01:02:56,945 --> 01:02:58,856
lt's this game.

435
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:09,859
The first time Alex and l did this...
lt was her idea.

436
01:03:11,585 --> 01:03:14,861
She likes to get her way.
-l've noticed.

437
01:03:16,705 --> 01:03:22,860
l like that. l fell in love with
her strength and her wild determination.

438
01:03:25,745 --> 01:03:29,784
When we had sex with others,
it was great. We had this bond.

439
01:03:29,945 --> 01:03:35,463
Eye contact, holding hands. lt was
great, we were on top of the world.

440
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:45,540
How did you feel last night?
-Good.

441
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:51,457
Julian would look at me, and...
l felt good.

442
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:55,778
That's nice.

443
01:03:58,545 --> 01:03:59,898
That's nice.

444
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:06,457
You're beautiful.

445
01:04:11,745 --> 01:04:13,098
Soft.

446
01:04:17,305 --> 01:04:19,057
God, you're warm.

447
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,378
Sweet.

448
01:04:29,145 --> 01:04:30,498
Honest.

449
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,018
So beautiful.

450
01:04:37,745 --> 01:04:39,098
So beautiful.

451
01:04:45,705 --> 01:04:47,263
Jesus. Alex.

452
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:53,181
l can't imagine my life without her.

453
01:05:10,385 --> 01:05:11,864
lt'll be alright.

454
01:05:15,865 --> 01:05:17,218
You think?

455
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,461
Maybe l should change.

456
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:34,864
ls it possible to change?

457
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:39,661
Yes. lt's possible.

458
01:05:44,745 --> 01:05:49,455
So what are our plans for tonight?
-Are you sure about that?

459
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:53,664
Timo will come around.
He's just having a bad day.

460
01:05:57,185 --> 01:05:59,858
l thought last night was hot.

461
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:05,663
lt was extraordinary.

462
01:06:10,145 --> 01:06:12,261
We fly solo on occasion.

463
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:23,455
l'll have a talk with him.

464
01:06:36,145 --> 01:06:38,136
Cute.

465
01:06:38,305 --> 01:06:39,977
Cute?

466
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:43,854
Sweet. A sweet girl.

467
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:48,262
Horrible glasses.

468
01:06:50,865 --> 01:06:52,378
l think it's touching.

469
01:06:57,505 --> 01:06:58,904
l see myself...

470
01:07:01,505 --> 01:07:03,063
and l get scared.

471
01:07:05,865 --> 01:07:07,218
Of what?

472
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:12,934
Believing l'm no good, and l'm ugly.

473
01:07:13,105 --> 01:07:17,064
Diana, that's nonsense.
-l know it is.

474
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:21,017
But l was a child.

475
01:07:23,985 --> 01:07:25,941
My sister Karin.

476
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:30,300
She looks angry.

477
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:35,458
But angry is still better than sad.

478
01:07:37,305 --> 01:07:38,658
ls it?

479
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:48,257
l don't think they loved me very much.

480
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:57,262
How is it possible,
if you look at this picture?

481
01:07:57,425 --> 01:08:00,656
How can you not love her?

482
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:22,218
lt's alright.

483
01:09:09,425 --> 01:09:11,985
No, it's Alex, a friend of the family.

484
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,262
Sure, l'll tell them.

485
01:09:25,305 --> 01:09:26,704
Hey, listen...

486
01:09:26,865 --> 01:09:28,776
shall we go?
-Sorry?

487
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:30,583
For a ride, or a walk?

488
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:35,102
Put that down. Let's go.
-What about Diana and Timo?

489
01:09:35,265 --> 01:09:39,656
They pass. Diana's taking a bath
and Timo's reading the Kama Sutra.

490
01:09:58,465 --> 01:10:00,456
Hey, look out, will you?

491
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:06,663
ls that better?

492
01:10:08,225 --> 01:10:12,457
How did you turn out this way?
Conceived by full moon?

493
01:10:17,265 --> 01:10:18,618
Here we go.

494
01:10:21,545 --> 01:10:22,898
Oh God, no.

495
01:10:23,945 --> 01:10:25,503
Don't.
-l am.

496
01:10:25,665 --> 01:10:28,657
So you can see that it's not half bad.

497
01:10:31,385 --> 01:10:33,057
l don't want you to.

498
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,978
Wait a second.

499
01:10:42,425 --> 01:10:44,461
This is a nice shot.

500
01:10:56,665 --> 01:10:58,018
Nice.

501
01:11:08,385 --> 01:11:10,580
Oh, nice. l like that.

502
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:23,857
Do you trust Diana?

503
01:13:28,745 --> 01:13:31,862
l saw Diana with Timo upstairs, and...

504
01:14:59,272 --> 01:15:03,424
You guys were gone long.
-lt's beautiful here.

505
01:15:03,592 --> 01:15:08,427
Alex wanted to see the area,
so l took her to the woods.

506
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:14,144
l wanted to see wild animals. l'll have
to come back for the mating season.

507
01:15:18,592 --> 01:15:21,868
Drinks anyone?
-Something strong.

508
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:24,910
Bitter Lemon?
-Whiskey.

509
01:15:25,072 --> 01:15:27,950
l have tea.
-l'll have the same as Timo.

510
01:15:31,712 --> 01:15:33,065
Have a good time?

511
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:38,548
Diana and l had a great time. Right?

512
01:15:43,032 --> 01:15:48,060
lt just goes to show how a day can
change. This morning we were leaving.

513
01:15:48,232 --> 01:15:50,746
l was in a bad mood this morning.

514
01:15:52,592 --> 01:15:56,551
Please forgive me if l was bit short
with you this morning.

515
01:15:56,712 --> 01:16:02,105
There's nothing to forgive.
l'm just happy you're still here.

516
01:16:02,272 --> 01:16:04,149
l feel heavenly.

517
01:16:20,832 --> 01:16:22,185
Need a hand?

518
01:16:24,032 --> 01:16:26,546
Everything okay?
-Yes.

519
01:16:32,952 --> 01:16:35,944
Think it'll happen tonight?

520
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:23,903
You're having fun.

521
01:17:33,912 --> 01:17:40,101
Now that were together at dinner,
l think the time is ripe for a toast.

522
01:17:40,272 --> 01:17:45,346
To a great weekend,
and the end of my life as a swinger.

523
01:17:48,232 --> 01:17:52,430
l've made a decision:
l'm not doing it anymore.

524
01:17:54,472 --> 01:17:59,148
What is this?
-l've supported your search for passion.

525
01:17:59,312 --> 01:18:03,942
And your desire for others,
but l don't want to share you anymore.

526
01:18:05,952 --> 01:18:11,549
l don't think this is our business.
-l want you here for the discussion.

527
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:16,024
You don't know what you're saying.
You're going too far.

528
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:20,470
l'm trying to tell you
that l can't handle it anymore.

529
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:22,588
So you lied to me.

530
01:18:25,072 --> 01:18:29,748
And what about all the talks
we had with others?

531
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:35,350
Any more lies? lf this was just a game,
how many more games are you playing?

532
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:37,980
That's not fair.
-Not fair?

533
01:18:38,152 --> 01:18:42,065
How do l know you're not pretending
in other situations?

534
01:18:42,232 --> 01:18:45,747
No, darling, l...
-Don't call me darling.

535
01:18:45,912 --> 01:18:49,746
Sorry, guys, but this is making me
feel uncomfortable...

536
01:18:49,912 --> 01:18:53,985
Madam's uncomfortable.
We've been listening to your crap...

537
01:18:54,152 --> 01:18:57,781
Hey, that's enough.
-Jesus, Alex.

538
01:19:07,032 --> 01:19:08,385
Sit down.

539
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:14,540
Nobody leaves the table until l say so.

540
01:19:30,472 --> 01:19:33,748
Timo doesn't want to do it anymore.

541
01:19:33,912 --> 01:19:37,905
What are you going
to do about it, Alex? Make him?

542
01:19:38,072 --> 01:19:42,941
Maybe you should talk to him.
l thought you were both so good at it.

543
01:19:53,192 --> 01:19:58,312
l don't like this, you guys.
-What else could l have said?

544
01:19:58,472 --> 01:20:02,511
You wouldn't have stopped.
We see how much this means to you.

545
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:09,191
And what does this mean to me?
-That you need more than l can give.

546
01:20:09,352 --> 01:20:12,185
You bastard.

547
01:20:12,352 --> 01:20:16,743
You're acting like l'm to blame.
-No one is to blame.

548
01:20:20,152 --> 01:20:24,703
Alexandra, you have no idea
how much l loved you.

549
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:40,023
When did this start?
-Some time ago.

550
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,980
And this weekend was the last straw.

551
01:20:44,152 --> 01:20:47,667
You did your best
to tell me something today.

552
01:20:47,832 --> 01:20:52,223
But this afternoon,
while you two were off somewhere...

553
01:20:52,392 --> 01:20:58,228
l discovered from Diana what it is
to be vulnerable. That was beautiful.

554
01:21:09,112 --> 01:21:10,704
Not a word out of you.

555
01:22:26,072 --> 01:22:30,941
What's your game? Are you going
to be laughing all the way home?

556
01:22:44,432 --> 01:22:48,345
You sounded a lot more convincing
yesterday, Timo.

557
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:52,630
You and your big mouth
telling us how it's done.

558
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:55,545
'Talk about it, reflection.'

559
01:22:58,152 --> 01:22:59,551
Amateurs.

560
01:23:01,952 --> 01:23:05,740
Alex locked herself in.
-Good for her.

561
01:23:19,112 --> 01:23:20,750
We're leaving.

562
01:23:33,912 --> 01:23:36,949
lt's just me out here. Can l come in?

563
01:24:17,592 --> 01:24:19,548
He'll come around.

564
01:24:21,992 --> 01:24:26,144
He always does.
He'll come around again.

565
01:24:29,952 --> 01:24:31,544
lf not...

566
01:24:31,712 --> 01:24:34,545
l'll just find myself another.

567
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,751
Who's he kidding?

568
01:24:45,512 --> 01:24:49,551
l mean, my diary is filled with...

569
01:24:51,312 --> 01:24:54,748
names of men,
who'd love to be in his shoes.

570
01:25:10,552 --> 01:25:12,543
What am l going to do?

571
01:25:14,712 --> 01:25:16,350
l'm lost.

572
01:25:43,152 --> 01:25:44,949
l'm so scared.

573
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:08,951
Thank you.

574
01:26:12,712 --> 01:26:14,065
Thank you.

575
01:27:57,792 --> 01:27:59,145
l, eh...

576
01:28:09,312 --> 01:28:13,351
This afternoon l did something
that's not quite...

577
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:18,547
which wasn't part of the deal.

578
01:28:21,912 --> 01:28:26,224
l went out with Alex this afternoon...

579
01:28:26,392 --> 01:28:28,348
and l'm not very happy...

580
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,950
with how it went.

581
01:28:35,192 --> 01:28:36,545
lt's alright.

582
01:28:41,392 --> 01:28:42,950
l love you.

583
01:28:44,832 --> 01:28:46,550
lt's alright.

584
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:40,145
Diana here.

585
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,105
Hi, Mom.

586
01:29:44,992 --> 01:29:47,552
Fine.
We're leaving shortly.

587
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,152
That was my friend Alex.

588
01:29:54,632 --> 01:29:56,350
With her husband Timo.

589
01:30:13,072 --> 01:30:14,425
Are you through?

590
01:30:17,552 --> 01:30:19,144
l don't care, Mom.

591
01:30:26,512 --> 01:30:27,865
There.

592
01:30:41,272 --> 01:30:46,710
Did you have a nice weekend?
-They can't all have such problems.

593
01:30:46,872 --> 01:30:48,225
lmpossible.
